## Parameters

This action provides a few input parameters that allow for customization:

### `token` (required)

Required input parameter to access the GitHub API for posting a pull request comment. Can be provided as
`${{ github.token }}`, `${{ env.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` or some personal access token with appropriate permissions.

If using the workflow-provided token, make sure that your workflow/job has write-permissions to pull requests.

### `planfile` (required)

The path to the planfile generated by `terraform plan` which holds the information about which changes ought to be
applied.

### `terraform-cmd`

The command to execute to call the Terraform binary. Defaults to `terraform`. You likely don't need to augment this
unless `terraform` cannot be found in the `PATH`.

### `working-directory`

The directory where the Terraform binary ought to be called. Defaults to `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE` and _must_ be specified if
`terraform init` has been run in a different directory. Should be specified relative to `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE`.

> [!IMPORTANT] <!-- prettier-ignore -->
> `planfile` must be specified relative to the working directory.

### `id`

A custom identifier for the Terraform execution. This allows to distinguish multiple Terraform runs: each sticky pull
request comment is tied to an ID.
